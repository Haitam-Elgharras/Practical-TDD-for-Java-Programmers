### Module 1: Introduction to Test Driven Development (TDD)

Test Driven Development (TDD) is a programming practice that involves writing tests before writing the actual code.
It's a method that has been around since 2003 and is closely associated with Agile development.

TDD follows a simple workflow known as Red, Green, Refactor:

1. **Red**: Write a test for the business logic, expecting it to fail since the code hasn't been written yet.
2. **Green**: Write the minimum code necessary to pass the test.
3. **Refactor**: Clean up the code and tests to make them more efficient and maintainable.

TDD is designed to help developers write clean, functional code. Although it's ideal for new projects,
the course will also cover how to apply TDD to existing codebases where TDD wasn't originally used.
